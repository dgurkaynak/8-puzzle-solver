# 8-puzzle-solver

A web app that solves 8-puzzle game with various tree
search techniques. It also visualizes the search tree and supports one-step iterations to explore and comprehend search algorithms. My project report can be found on [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0RFeAd0sIc6clZleGRlc2VQNmM/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-DDPwqNilAupxFMlwN_8PMQ).
